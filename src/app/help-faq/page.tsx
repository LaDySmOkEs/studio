                <p><strong>Why Jurisdiction Matters:</strong> Jurisdiction determines which court system (federal, state, local) has the authority to hear a particular case. Filing in the wrong court can lead to your case being dismissed. Different laws, procedures, and even interpretations of laws apply in different jurisdictions.</p>
                
                <div>
                  <h4 className="font-semibold text-foreground/90">Federal Jurisdiction:</h4>
                  <p>Federal courts primarily hear cases involving:</p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-1">
                    <li>Violations of federal laws (e.g., U.S. Constitution, federal statutes like civil rights under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, bankruptcy, copyright, patent law).</li>
                    <li>Cases where the United States government is a party (either suing or being sued).</li>
                    <li>Disputes between states.</li>
                    <li>"Diversity Jurisdiction": Cases between citizens of different states where the amount in controversy exceeds a certain threshold (currently $75,000).</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h4 className="font-semibold text-foreground/90">State Jurisdiction:</h4>
                  <p>State courts have broad jurisdiction over most types of cases that occur within their borders, including:</p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-1">
                    <li>Most criminal matters (violations of state laws).</li>
                    <li>Family law (divorce, child custody, adoption).</li>
                    <li>Contract disputes and business law.</li>
                    <li>Personal injury cases (torts).</li>
                    <li>Probate and estate matters.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p className="mt-1">Each state has its own court system, typically structured with trial courts, appellate courts, and a state supreme court.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h4 className="font-semibold text-foreground/90">Local/County/Municipal Courts:</h4>
                  <p>These courts are generally part of the state court system but handle more localized or specific types of cases, such as:</p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-1">
                    <li>Traffic violations.</li>
                    <li>Small claims cases (disputes involving small amounts of money).</li>
                    <li>Minor criminal offenses (misdemeanors).</li>
                    <li>Violations of local ordinances (e.g., zoning, public health).</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p className="mt-1">The names and functions of these courts vary significantly from state to state.</p>

                <div>
                  <h4 className="font-semibold text-foreground/90">Overlapping & Special Jurisdictions:</h4>
                  <p>Jurisdictional issues can become complex, especially with:</p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-1">
                    <li><strong>Concurrent Jurisdiction:</strong> Situations where both federal and state courts might have the authority to hear a case. The plaintiff may choose where to file, or a defendant might seek to "remove" a case from state to federal court if certain conditions are met.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tribal Jurisdiction:</strong> Native American tribal courts have jurisdiction over certain matters involving tribal members or occurring on tribal lands. This is a distinct and complex area of law.</li>
                    <li><strong>Military Jurisdiction:</strong> Governed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for U.S. service members.</li>
                    <li><strong>Territorial Courts:</strong> For U.S. territories like Puerto Rico, Guam, etc.</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                  <h4 className="font-semibold text-foreground/90">Determining Jurisdiction for Your Case:</h4>
                  <p>This can be one ofr the most challenging aspects of starting a legal action. Key factors include where the incident occurred, where the parties reside or do business, and the subject matter of the dispute. Incorrectly determining jurisdiction can have serious consequences for your case.</p>

                <p>For a production version of DUE PROCESS AI, the following measures would be paramount:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
                    <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> All sensitive legal information would be stored using robust encryption-at-rest and in-transit. Access controls and regular security audits would be implemented.</li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Clear data retention policies would be established, detailing how long sensitive legal narratives and other user data are stored and under what conditions they are deleted. We would aim for compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA if applicable).</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The application's backend and infrastructure would be designed to accommodate a growing user base and increasing data load, ensuring performance and reliability. The frontend is built using Next.js, a modern framework capable of handling scalable web applications.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mt-2">We are committed to user privacy and data security. These principles would guide the development of a production-ready application.</p>
